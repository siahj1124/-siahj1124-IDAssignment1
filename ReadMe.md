The project name is called hao jun's portfolio

I wanted to make a minimalistic webpage design to allow the user to digest the information with the information stick out with dark and light colours I use a gradient blue fill for my dark shade to make it easier on the user eyes allowing for the bright white light font of the information to stand out. I used sans serif font for a more sleek and mordern look.

Home - allows users to choose whether or not to hire me by browersing the webpage to know more about me, by having them read the infomation about me on the webpage
...
In future i hope to add more feature such as :
More thing for my portfolio
More links to social media accounts
